What is time complexity of following code :

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
        
Select your answer from the following options:
O(N * N)
O(N * log N)
O(N * log(log(N)))
O(N) <-- ANSWER
O(N * Sqrt(N))

complexities getting added in such form -->

n + n/2 + n/4 + 

we take the heighest and leave the constants , O(n)
