What is the time complexity of the following code :

        int a = 0, i = N;
        while (i > 0) {
            a += i;
            i /= 2;
        }
        
Select your answer from the following options:
O(N)
O(Sqrt(N))
O(N / 2)
O(log N) <-- ANSWER
O(log(log N))

EXPLANATION --> 

n -> n/2 -> n/4 -> n/8 -> _ _ _ _ -> 0 (makes a tree of height log(n) )
